# DATAVERS ANAVA 2025 - Machine Breakdown Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of the **DATAVERS ANAVA 2025** competition, where participants are challenged to develop the best solution for **machine breakdown classification**. 
The competition consists of multiple stages, starting from **data analysis and model development** to **paper writing and final presentation**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Code (Qualification Stage)**
   - Developing a machine damage classification model using a data-driven approach.
   - Performing data exploration and preprocessing.
   - Applying various machine learning algorithms to improve model accuracy.
   - Evaluating model performance using multiple metrics.

2. **Paper (Semi-Final Stage)**
   - Documenting the methodology used in modeling.
   - Analyzing results and discussing the impact of the applied methods.
   - Comparing models with alternative approaches.

3. **Presentation (Final Stage)**
   - Preparing an engaging and informative presentation.
   - Clearly explaining the solution concisely with data-driven insights.
   - Visualizing results to support the conducted analysis.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow)
- Kaggle Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
